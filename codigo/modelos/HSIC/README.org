* =HSIC-Bottleneck=
This is the released repo for our work entitled `The HSIC Bottleneck: Deep Learning without Back-Propagation`. All the experiments in the paper were produced by this repository.

* =Updates=
- *2020/Aug/7*
I'm preparing a different repository to summarize my PhD works including HSIC-bottleneck, with better project architecture and API. If people would like to extend our work, please contact with us.
- *2019/Nov/14*
Our work has been accepted by AAAI2020 international conference.

* =Researcher=
Here's the guide to work with HSIC-bottleneck

** Environment
- pytorch-1.1.0
- torchvision-0.3.0
- numpy-1.16.4
- scipy-1.3.0
- tqdm-4.33.0
- yaml-5.1.1

** Experimenting
- Reproducibility: Please refer to the task oriented scripts guide ([[file:scripts/README.org][link]])
- Configuration: Please refer to configuration guide to suit your interests ([[file:config/README.org][link]])

** Developing
- For people would like to extend our work, we have prepare the simple template for your toy experiment to make your life easier ([[file:tests][link]])
- Otherwise, please see the developing guide for your intersts ([[file:source][link]])

* =Features=

** loggers
For every single training, the system will keep almost all of information in the *assets/*/raw* folder and make the symlink under *assets/** pointing to the latest experiments. After the training, the system will automatically generate the experiment figure in the folder.

** visualization
Except the static experiment figures, you can also do animation based on the saved loggers. Checkout the script [[file:tests/plot-result-dynamic.py][link]] for more information.

*needle test*
- Model 786 to 1 output of backprop(left) and HSIC-bottleneck comparison
|[[file:assets/samples/fig8a-needle-1d-dist-backprop.gif]]|[[file:assets/samples/fig8b-needle-1d-dist-hsictrain.gif]]|

*unformatted activation distribution*
- Showing activation distribution from MNIST class 1 (top-left) to class 9 (bottom-right) respectively, this is what we called unformatted information as the class of images might be activated at different entry of the output. (In this case, class 1 images are gathering around entry 5 by looking at top-left figure)
[[file:assets/samples/fig3-layer2-hsic-solve-actdist-mnist-batch.gif]]
(please note that the above results are not trained with optimial parameters, they are only for showing animation purpose)

** learning triggers
The entry point of our framework is with *run_hsicbt* command plus a configuration file ([[file:config/][link]]). You can also specify the argument to overwrite the config file to achieve the goal of parameter searching as in task scripts for instance.

WIP

* =Cite=
